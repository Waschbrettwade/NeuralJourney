# NeuralJourney
What does a banana say when it sees a guest in my repository? Yellow!

My name is Lars Winkler. I am 25 years old now and I have finished studying Mathematics in September 2020 at the Heinrich-Heine-University DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. My master thesis dealt with partial differential equations, more specifically it was about Strichartz-estimates from homogeneous Sobolev spaves with real order to mixed L_t^p L_x^q spaces for the wave equation with radially symmetric data. Apart from science, I am fanatic about sports and movement and pushing my training partners and me to the limit. I am looking forward to my next triathlon and I am currently working on the Iron Cross. 

But right here, we will be focused more on the Neuron Cross. I will learn how to write Neural Networks and by doing so, I will create a tutorial, a guide and maybe I will expand it as a blog. We will be concerned about clarity above all and not about efficiency (at first at least). I am very curious about how this kind of Machine Learning works and I want to dive deeper into it while honing my programming skills further. That being said, if you find inefficiencies in my code, please feel free to share your knowledge with me. At least in the first chapters, it will be my main goal to write comprehensive code rather than efficient code. For me, loops are much easier to comment and understand than short calculations with huge vectors of many dimensions. 

Doing so, I will be following James V. Stone and his book "Artificial Intelligence Engines: A Tutorial Introduction to the Mathematics of Deep Learning". This will not be a tutorial on how to get started with Python nor will I be explaining the mathematics. I assume you have a certain knowledge of analysis, i.e. vectors, matrices, differentiation, partial differentiation etc. I will be providing links where you can look up certain topics and add some math explanations that I will create in LaTeX. 

This will be a journey for me and I hope that I can be of help to you and I hope you can be of help to me, either.

That being said, let's get started!
