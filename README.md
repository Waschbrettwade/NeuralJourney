# NeuralJourney
My name is Lars Winkler. I am 25 years old now and I have finished studying Mathematics in September 2020 at the Heinrich-Heine-University DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. My master thesis dealt with partial differential equations, more specifically it was about Strichartz-estimates from homogeneous Sobolev spaves with real order to mixed L_t^p L_x^q spaces for the wave equation with radially symmetric data. Apart from science, I am fanatic about sports and movement and pushing my training partners and me to the limit. I am looking forward to my next triathlon and I am currently working on the Iron Cross. 

But right here, we will be focused more on the Neuron Cross. I will learn how to write Neural Networks and by doing so, I will create a tutorial, a guide and maybe I will expand it as a blog. I am very curious about how this kind of Machine Learning works and I want to dive deeper into it while honing my programming skills further.

Doing so, I will be following James V. Stone and his book "Artificial Intelligence Engines: A Tutorial Introduction to the Mathematics of Deep Learning". This will not be a tutorial on how to get started with Python nor will I be explaining the mathematics. I assume you have a certain knowledge of analysis, i.e. vectors, matrices, differentiation, partial differentiation etc. I will be providing links where you can look up certain topics, but I will not go in depth explaining them. In time I might add some written out notes as photos. 

This will be a journey for me and I hope that I can be of help to you. As I have said, at this very early point, I won't explain the mathematics. Maybe in time, I will ad photos or if there is a blog with a comment section or if i submit a public email, you can ask some questions and I can add according features to the code or make it better with your suggestions and tips, but as of now, I am mainly diving into this and getting started.

That being said, let's get started!
