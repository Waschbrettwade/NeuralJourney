# NeuralJourney
I will learn how to write Neural Networks and by doing so, I will create a tutorial, a guide and maybe I will expand it as a blog.

Doing so, I will be following James V. Stone and his book "Artificial Intelligence Engines: A Tutorial Introduction to the Mathematics of Deep Learning". 
This will not be a tutorial on how to get started with Python nor will I be explaining the mathematics. I assume you have a certain knowledge of analysis, i.e. vectors,
matrices, differentiation, partial differentiation etc. I will be providing links where you can look up certain topics, but I will not go in depth explaining them.

This will be a journey for me and I hope that I can be of help to you. As I have said, at this very early point, I won't explain the mathematics. Maybe in time, if there is 
a blog with a comment section or if i submit a public email, you can ask some questions and I can add according features to the code or make it better with your suggestions and
tips, but as of now, I am mainly diving into this and getting started.

That being said, let's get started!
